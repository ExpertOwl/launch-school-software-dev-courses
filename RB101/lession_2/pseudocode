a method that returns the sum of two integers
Given integer_1 and integer_2
START 
SET result = integer_1 + integer_2
PRINT result
END

a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START 
given array of strings to be combined called array_of_strings
SET concat_string = ''
SET iterator = 0 
WHILE iterator <= length of array_of_strings
  SET concat_string += string within array of strings at space iterator
iterator += 1
print concat_string
END
  
a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
given an array of integers called array_of_integers

START 
SET iterator = 0 
SET odd_elements = []

WHILE iterator <= length of array_of_integers
  IF iterator is even
    SET odd_elements +=  integer at array_of_integers[iterator]
PRINT odd_elements
END

a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return ni

START
SET character = given character to track 
SET count = 0
SET iterator = 0 

WHILE iterator > length of string
  IF letter of string at position iterator == character
    IF count == 2
        PRINT iterator
    ELSE count += 1
  ELSE 
    go to next iteration
PRINT nil 
END

a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:
Given arrays first_array and second_array

START 
SET index = 0
SET new_array  = []
WHILE array 2 is not empty 
    SET new_array << pop first element in array_1
    SET new_array << pop first element in array_2
  
PRINT new_array 
END
